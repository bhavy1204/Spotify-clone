Welcome to the Spotify Clone project! This web application emulates an older version of Spotify, providing a familiar interface for music enthusiasts. While not fully functional yet, this project marks my first significant endeavor after learning HTML and CSS, and I'm continuously working on enhancing its features.

## Features

- **User Interface**: A visually appealing layout mimicking Spotify's classic design.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Basic interactivity using JavaScript for a dynamic user experience.
